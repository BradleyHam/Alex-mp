    overview: `
    Working for Edinburgh South.

    \n\n

    Many elected representatives in the United Kingdom are not serving constituents properly. Often attending to their own agenda, or towing the party line, at the expense of the public interest. 

    \n\n
    
    As an Independent Member of Parliament, my aim, first and foremost, is to serve with integrity and honesty. I will vote on issues according to what I believe is right, based on the consistent feedback of my constituents. I will not vote according to party politics or top-down, command and control strategies.

    \n\n
    
    As an independent MP for Westminster, my job is to represent the electorate on the big issues, such as International Relations, Economic Policy, Environment, Trade, and Industry. But alongside this, I intend do a better job of getting the basics right. I will be focussing on what I can control, such as creating stronger communities, assisting with local issues in Edinburgh South, and holding local government to account. 

    \n\n
    
    I believe strongly that a sense of community is increasingly lacking in the UK, a facet of society which is necessary for easing many of the burdens of modern society. Once elected, I will make the changes required to build strong communities. 

    \n\n
    
    Due to the dissatisfaction with the major parties, the coming General Election offers a once in a generation opportunity for independent politicians to drive real change on a national and global scale. Polling guru Professor John Curtis, of Strathclyde University, has proclaimed that “a hung parliament is the best labour can hope for.” This means that Independents, and small parties, can have a significant influence on policy decisions, by leading all party initiatives, and forming alliances around certain issues, withholding votes if necessary. 

    \n\n
    

    I will have the freedom and public profile to raise the concerns of voters directly, rather than filtering my statements through a party machine. I will not be beholden to the demands of large, political donors, who pay for influence, and undermine democracy. I will not be vulnerable to threats against my own career if I don’t follow the party whip. 

    \n\n
    
    For all these reasons, getting more Independent politicians into government will be vital for holding the larger parties to account, ensuring they deliver on their promises to voters.

    \n\n
    
    As an independent candidate, I will use my vote to bring forward policy which helps my constituents but also entirety of the United Kingdom.

    \n\n
    
    I seek to bring an end to the partisan divisions which are tearing this country apart. Because we believe that in Britain, we all have much more in common than that which separates us. 

    \n\n
    
    The solutions to problems such as; government corruption, attacks on civil liberties, failure of politicians to abide by national and international rule of law, and erosion of democracy by mega corporations, cut across party lines. 

    \n\n
    
    The British public are crying out for representatives who simply perform their main function well, which is to serve the public. We do not want politicians who use their positions to line their own pockets or protect their own careers within their chosen party. This is why I am standing as an independent, so I can act on behalf of our community, with selfless commitment, and courage.

        'economy': `The United Kingdom is in dire straits economically. The population is facing a cost-of-living crisis. Everyone is increasingly feeling their budgets stretched to the limit. 29% of all children of all UK children are now living in poverty and economic inequality is rising rapidly, causing a multitude of deleterious effects.

        \n\n


        According to analysis by Oxfam, the richest 1% of people in the UK now control more wealth than 70% of the population combined. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows that £3.6 Million in net wealth is now required to be part of this 1%.

        \n\n
        
        These problems have been caused by policies put in place by successive Labour and Conservative governments. They are not inevitable. It doesn’t have to be this way.

        \n\n
        
        The primary reason for the cost-of-living crisis is that large companies are engaging in monopolistic business practices, lawfare and aggressive tactics to protect themselves from competition and increase their profit margins. The energy companies, transport firms, banks, mega landlords, insurance firms and other private companies use their monopoly pricing power to unfairly increase prices. 

        \n\n
        
        Individual households owe £1.8 trillion in personal debt with well over £200 billion being paid each year in interest. Households are struggling to meet interest payments on mortgages, car loans, bank overdrafts and credit cards. Students are racking up huge student loan debts to pay for their tuition or accommodation and living costs while at university. Businesses are failing to invest due to massive amounts of leverage on their balance sheets. All the payments made to service the debt burden go straight into the financial sector and don’t contribute to real economic growth. Instead dragging us into a downward spiral.

        \n\n
        
        I will use my knowledge of the banking and financial sector to hold these large companies to account. Making sure they bear the brunt of rising costs due to geopolitics or other external factors. Putting an end to industrial scale price gouging and financial exploitation.  

        \n\n
        
        Increasing economic inequality means that there are not enough good quality jobs being created for ambitious graduates. Small businesses are unable to get started with limited capital. Potential founders of small businesses do not have adequate funds available and hence fail to create more jobs. 

        \n\n
        
        I will make a push for Scotland to provide better education and training for people, so we can fill roles locally, and provide our own services. We should not have to rely on foreign companies contracted to do work, which is often the case. 

        \n\n
        
        The UK has a history of placing too much emphasis on university education. I will support a movement towards placing more emphasis on other forms of education, such as colleges and vocational training.  I will give these different forms of learning the respect they deserve, ensuring our economy runs efficiently, creates good jobs, and generates the skilled workers we depend on.

        \n\n
        
        Several mega corporations and finance firms are sitting on vast cash piles, failing to invest because aggregate demand is so low. In simple terms, people have very little disposable income, so these huge companies don’t have any incentive to create new products or services for people to buy. This puts a dampener on job growth.

        \n\n
        
        If left unchecked, economic inequality does tend to rise over time. One factor we can control is ensuring that most of the tax burden is shouldered by individuals who control large amounts of wealth. At present, too much tax is being paid by low, middle, and medium high-income individuals. Not enough is being paid by the super-rich. A properly enforced wealth tax is not only desirable for positive social outcomes. At this point, it is an absolute necessity. 

        \n\n
        
        The United Kingdom is the biggest enabler of tax evasion and tax avoidance in the world, through our network of offshore tax havens. The tax justice network estimates that at least £158 billion of tax is avoided each year. These tax havens rarely benefit even high earners in the United Kingdom. Disproportionately, they are utilised by the likes of multibillion-pound, international private equity firms, hedge funds and private offices. This system is deeply unjust and must be replaced.

        \n\n
        
        Currently, the United Kingdom has over £380 billion in regressive tax breaks, primarily for rich mega corporations. These tax breaks are regressive, because they redistribute wealth upwards, increasing economic inequality. There is plenty of money available to solve our problems and create a better world.

        \n\n
        
        I will lead and vote in favour of initiatives to crack down on financial exploitation, ensuring that wage earners and small business’ pay less tax, while mega corporations and billionaires pay more. Putting an end to the debt driven, rentier economy, ensuring that everyone in the United Kingdom is paid a living wage. I will also vote in favour of divestment from projects which do not serve our interests.`,

        //----------
        'nhs': `When founded, the NHS was intended to be a holistic National Healthcare System. After years of being pulled apart by consecutive Labour and Conservative Governments, it has become an ineffective, sick care system. Every part of the healthcare system is interlinked. Failure to address one area, such as social or mental health care leads to knock on effects. We need to take more of a holistic approach to healthcare, taking each part of a person’s life cycle into account. One element cannot be separated from the whole. 

        \n\n

        Public ownership is key for vital parts of the economy such as healthcare. There should not be a profit motive in the healthcare system because it creates too many undesirable conflicts of interest. I will campaign for a national care service and better treatment of the elderly and infirm more generally. Having worked in the healthcare and banking sectors myself for several years, and comparing the United Kingdom to other developed economies, it’s clear that there is more than enough money available to fund a proper healthcare service in this country.

        \n\n
        
        Another major issue in the United Kingdom right now is excessive NHS waiting times. Taxpayers are demanding a better service based on their contributions. This is partly due to underfunding, but also due to the issues mentioned above about the lack of a coherent, holistic approach. Privatisation, bureaucracy, and division have separated different aspects of the system. 

        \n\n
        
        Private companies claim to be easing the burden on the NHS, but in reality, they generally only take easier cases which are profitable, with the difficult cases being forced back into the public system. 

        \n\n
        
        Far too much money is spent on private contractors and consultants charging excessively high margins. The largely privatised social care sector is in crisis, suffering from chronic labour shortages due to Brexit, changes in working patterns following the Covid-19 lockdown and low pay/poor working conditions. 

        \n\n
        
        Private healthcare companies, including care homes, have been hollowed out by private equity owners which buy them out, strip their assets and load them with debt. Local authorities must pay higher rates to keep these businesses afloat, and less investment is made due to the debt burden. Profits are taken offshore by the owners through a labyrinthian network of tax havens with no benefit to the British economy. This is a lose-lose situation for everyone. Taxpayers pay more for these private companies to service their debts. Very little investment is made in facilities and staff are paid poorly. The government has less spending power and the quality of care is worse for British citizens.

        \n\n
        
        This problem is exacerbated by the lack of doctors in the United Kingdom. Many of whom are choosing to go abroad because they find the British economy unaffordable. Brexit has clearly contributed to this shortage of workers, but the issue is intimately tied to the other challenges we face in this country. Once we create a fairer, more just society, more doctors will want to train, live and work here. It is impossible to separate this out from the other issues we all face currently.  

        \n\n
        
        As an independent I will do everything I can to bring about the overhaul, and reversal of privatisation that the entire NHS needs to make it work more effectively. I will campaign to bring it back to the holistic service it should be, in which excessive profits are not siphoned off by private companies. Where more money is made available to pay frontline staff the fair salary which they deserve.`,
       //------------
        'environment': `
        We need a fair and just green transition which benefits everyone. Not just private jet setting politicians and their billionaire backers. 

        \n\n
        
        I attended the Glasgow COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in person in 2021. I witnessed first-hand the hundreds of lobbyists sent from the petrochemical industry to water down any proposals which would impact profits. As a result, these conferences have been an unmitigated failure, and governments must be held accountable for the broken promises made. 

        \n\n
        
        Too many projects related to climate change and environmental protection have been turned into money making schemes which enrich investors and government bureaucrats but fail to achieve the desired outcomes. 

        \n\n
        
        A study in the Financial Times recently showed that companies with higher “ESG,” ratings were no more environmentally friendly than any of their peer competitors. Such reports are “greenwashed,” to fit in with the agenda of private corporations, and ESG reports are not even a requirement, so those who have large carbon footprints can do so virtually anonymously if they wish.

        \n\n
        
        The major parties have been backtracking on green policies for many years. They have promised billions for renewable projects to get votes. But very rarely follow through once they hold power. This lack of action has allowed many of the “tipping points,” to be crossed already. It is imperative that we put our energy into preparing for this future, and reorganising society to minimise harm.

        \n\n
        
        We don’t have to wait for the next generation to start feeling the effects of the climate crisis. The crisis is happening now. We have seen a measurable rise in forest fires, crop failures, droughts, and extinction of species. I strongly believe that human beings must learn to live in harmony with nature.

        \n\n
        
        Mass migration, resource-based conflicts and epidemics/pandemics are impossible to untangle from these issues and are set to increase as a result.

        \n\n
        
        A radical approach is now required to address the environmental crisis. Fundamental changes to the global economic system and its incentive structure are needed. We cannot expect countries in the global south to allow their populations to live in poverty to meet targets. We must also acknowledge that oil is needed for purposes other than energy production, so ensure that we set realistic expectations.

        \n\n
        
        We also need better protections to make sure that funds which are allocated for environmental issues do not end up in the hands of despots, oligarchs, or corrupt politicians around the world.

        \n\n
        
        If elected I will vote for green policies which bring hope of a better future and benefits to the current community.`,
        //---------------
        'pensions': `It is imperative that we take much better care of our elderly population. 

        \n\n

        Pensioners livelihoods have been attacked by all the major parties in various ways. The government is clearly thinking of increasing retirement age, this should not happen unless the people of the United Kingdom themselves democratically support it. 

        \n\n
        
        The triple lock on pensions does not go far enough to protect pensioners from inflation. Pensioners have fixed incomes. So while prices rise during our cost of living crisis they suffer greatly. 
        Both Labour and Conservatives would not commit to compensating the “WASPI” (Women Against Pension Inequality) campaign. This is deeply unjust considering the promises that have been made in the past. Women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly. This has been confirmed as “unacceptable,” by the independent Parlimentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO).

        \n\n
        
        There is always money available for bank bailouts and funding war, so there should also be money available to recompensate these women.

        \n\n
        
        As mentioned in other areas of my manifesto, the cost-of-living crisis must be addressed immediately by cracking down on huge financial, energy, transport and other companies who use their monopoly pricing power to unfairly raise prices.

        \n\n
        
        As an Independent politician I am not tied to financial backers who ensure I cannot vote with integrity or bring forward policies which will make real change.`,
        //-------------
       
        'education': `Teachers and students in school are suffering due to mismanagement, lack of support, increasing class sizes and discipline issues. All classrooms should have access to teaching assistants & specialist teachers if required. Teachers need to be less burdened by overwhelming amounts of non-essential paperwork which distracts them from doing their jobs.

        \n\n

        Smart phone and social media use in schools must be curtailed and we need to ensure that we are creating a more hopeful future for children. Many young children are suffering from suicidal ideation and mental health issues due to bullying. This is exacerbated by social media as they find themselves unable to get away from their bullies.

        \n\n
        
        If all other options are exhausted, schools must be able to expel disruptive pupils, for whom better alternative education must be provided.

        \n\n
        
        As an MP I will vote for policy which allows teachers to get back to doing their job, which is educating our children. By building stronger communities, as I alluded to before, we can help parents who need extra support to guide children through their schooling years. 
        `,
        //------------
        'Democratic Reform':`The House of Lords is a deeply undemocratic institution which needs reform. Politicians should not issue political honours and cash-for-honours must be clamped down on, and the Lords should not be regarded as a home for retired politicians who are often strongly disliked by the public. The need for hereditary peerages in 2024 is largely indefensible and the Lords should be transformed into more of a merit based, democratic model.

        \n\n

        MPs second jobs should all be curtailed unless directly relevant to their role as MP. Working for or owning financial firms presents far too many conflicts of interest. We need to ensure that MPs focus on serving their constituents.

        \n\n
        
        Scotland has led the way in adding elements of proportional representation into its electoral system. The rest of the UK must follow suit so that even small parties can achieve some representation. No vote should be a “wasted vote,” and everyone should have their voices heard.

        \n\n
        
        We must also ensure that our democratic freedoms and personal liberty is not eroded in other ways. 

        \n\n
        
        Growth of the surveillance state in the United Kingdom should be closely monitored with democratic oversight. Making sure that new technologies such as facial “emotion recognition software,” are not used to infringe on our rights as citizens.  ` ,
        //------------
        'Young People': `Young people in the United Kingdom are faced with an increasingly uncertain future, which is causing a major mental health crisis. During their formative years, they have been hit with economic turmoil, environmental degradation, pandemic, and proxy war. They have witnessed their hopes and dreams being dashed at every stage. 

        \n\n

        Many young people feel like they are on a treadmill which keeps getting faster and faster, and they never seem to get ahead no matter how hard they try.

        \n\n
        
        We need to end the generational divisions in the United Kingdom and learn to support each other as a community once more. In the end we all benefit when we come together and help each other. Political parties must not take the views of young people for granted. 

        \n\n
        
        The struggles with mental health and loneliness which many young people face, due to being ever more atomised by technology and economic pressures, are complex problems to solve. These issues are tied up with every other point on this manifesto. In short, we need a radical restructuring of society on every level, so that young people can once again have hope for a better future. More therapy and mental health services alone will not fix the root causes of these problems.

        \n\n
        
        I will ensure that the voices of the young people in my constituency are listened to and that I can take their views forward to Westminster. I will hold forums with young people on a regular basis to ensure their worries and burdens are not ignored.`,

        //------------
        'Housing': `believe everyone should have the chance to own their own home on a single income in the UK. However, for those who choose it, rent should not be excessive and allow people to have a decent quality of living. 

        \n\n

        House prices and rents have risen to exorbitant levels, while real inflation adjusted incomes have stagnated. This discrepancy has created a major challenge for the UK economy. On one hand, people are struggling to afford housing, but on the other, there are large numbers of people who have most of their life savings tied up in the value of their property. Some of whom may be relying on these savings to fund their retirement. In effect, their future livelihood depends on property prices rising. We need to create policies which mean neither group is adversely affected.

        \n\n
        
        To solve this problem, we need solutions which address both sides of this issue. It must not be seen as a zero-sum game which pits people against each other.

        \n\n
        
        Firstly, we need to look at how much money is being siphoned off unproductively by the banks, other financial institutions, and mega landlords. Rents, mortgage payments and other costs can be reduced massively by taxing away any “unearned income,” which flows into the financial sector without providing any meaningful benefit for the real economy. For example, the bumper profits banks have made during the last few years, based on charging higher interest rates, are clearly not justified.

        \n\n
        
        Secondly, my belief is that there should be a reasonable limit on the number of properties owned by a single individual/company. It is not ethical for large amounts of housing to be commoditised and bought and sold in the same manner as other goods.

        \n\n

        Another problem plaguing the UK economy is the overly restrictive planning regime in which applications are often processed slowly. This is one of the key factors behind one of the UK’s largest economic issues, which is stagnant productivity growth. Many sectors of the economy are being held back, with housing being the most obvious.
        As an independent MP I can ensure my constituents and community are represented in any changes put forward for vote in Parliament. My integrity will not be tested due to top down pressure within a political party.`,

        // -------

        'Immigration': `We need an immigration policy which works better for everyone.

        \n\n

        We have a moral duty to help refugees from war torn countries. We need to support people fleeing from terror and war-torn countries, not treating them like criminals. But immigration should not be used to artificially suppress wages and shore up the power of big capital, which is often the case. This doesn’t benefit anyone, including the migrants themselves, who often face financial abuse, poverty, and unsuitable working conditions.

        \n\n
        
        Our primary focus must be to help countries to independently thrive, become self-sufficient and vibrant economically. We must stop creating the conditions in other countries, such as war or financial exploitation, which force people to leave their home nations.

        \n\n
        
        When surveyed, most migrants leave their home countries out of necessity, not choice. These individuals often come from war torn areas which have been left devastated by Western backed regime change operations, conflicts over resources, such as oil and gas, or through debt based financial imperialism. 
        `,
        'Israeli Palestinian Conflict': `The ongoing genocide in Gaza is an issue of global significance. Palestine, historically, is where civilisations meet, and where religions and cultures clash. Actions taken in the region have the potential to spark religious and ethnic conflict around the world. It’s vital that the issue is handled properly, and within the boundaries of international law, by world powers.

        \n\n

        I do not support the right of the British, through the Balfour declaration, to hand over land which wasn’t theirs to give. I believe this was morally wrong from the outset, and the conflict following this decision has been made inevitable as a result.

        \n\n
        
        The International Court of Justice, the highest court in the world, has now ruled unequivocally that there is a plausible case for genocide in Gaza. It very clearly states in the ruling that all countries which are signatories to the Genocide Convention, must take steps to prevent and ongoing genocide.

        \n\n
        
        This means that arms sales to Israel from the United Kingdom must be stopped entirely.

        \n\n
        
        Regardless of where you stand on the issue overall. It is undeniably the case that Israel, the United States, and United Kingdom have failed to uphold their obligations under international law. The cynical cutting of funding to UNWRA, the United Nations aid agency, proved this without a shadow of a doubt. 

        \n\n
        
        Both major parties in the United Kingdom have not only breached international law, but they have actively aided and abetted in an ongoing genocide, by continuing with arms sales, military, and diplomatic support.

        \n\n
        
        It is highly likely that major political figures in the United Kingdom will face future consequences at the International Court of Justice in the Hague. 

        \n\n
        
        It is imperative that we ensure the politicians who represent these parties are voted out. Otherwise, they will act against the British people for purposes of self-preservation. 

        \n\n
        
        We must not allow for this issue to be tarnished by false accusations of antisemitism. This is not a religious matter. Rather, it relates to an occupying power committing a genocide. 

        \n\n
        
        While it does appear that Israel is using these accusations to shield itself from criticism, we must acknowledge the fact that antisemitism is very real and Jewish people have indeed faced numerous genocidal attacks throughout history.

        \n\n
        
        Sadly, Israel’s recent actions do not make Jewish people safer. Interlinking Zionism and Judaism is dangerous for all Jewish people and must stop. However, even for people living in Israel, we must be sympathetic to the generational trauma that many Jewish people carry in their family histories. Any future resolution must take that into account. 

        \n\n
        
        I will work towards peace and justice in the region. Creating amity not enmity between different groups. `,

        //---------------
        "Scottish Independence": `My role as an MP, first and foremost, is to protect democracy. 

        \n\n

        I believe strongly in self-determination. I will encourage open, free, and fair debate, supporting people’s right to choose.

        \n\n
        
        I trust my constituents and the people who make up Scotland to make their own decision about our future as a nation. I will support whichever is the majority view on Scottish independence in my constituency. 

        \n\n
        
        Alongside this, I will actively campaign for more representation in Westminster for Scottish MPs. Our numbers have been reduced due to the alteration of election boundaries and other anti-democratic tactics. There are threats to cut them even lower, which reduces our ability to influence the decisions made on our behalf in the country. 

        \n\n
        
        I will also look for opportunities, wherever possible, to increase the level of control Scotland has over its own affairs. Especially regarding issues such as nuclear weapons being based in Scotland.`,


        //----------------

        'National Security': `The world is interdependent in nature. Threats outside the UK affect us within it. We should be focussing on our domestic responsibilities and keeping our citizens safe rather than projecting power and making threats overseas.

        \n\n

        NATO is no longer fit for purpose unless it was radically restructured/reorientated. Britain and the United States are not the “policemen of the world,” that is over.

        \n\n
        
        The fear-driven forever wars and the revolving door between politics and the military industrial complex must be finally and completely closed.

        \n\n
        
        Senior military leaders could be debarred from lucrative positions with defence companies to ensure complete avoidance of any conflict of interest. I support legislation carrying serious and critical consequences for any prejudice in advice or decisions that could be interpreted as influencing procurement or similar decisions.

        \n\n
        
        I would work for a searching enquiry conducted transparently about any links between funding structures, and links between our own government officials and foreign governments or other influential individuals who are not aligned with our values. I would demand procedures being put in place to protect national security.

        There is a responsibility to take actions to stop the killing in the Russia/Ukraine conflict, rather than to weaponise Ukraine and thus fuel the conflict. This includes exposing links between senior British government officials and Russian oligarchs and ending corruption and external interference on Government decisions and extending a transparent and open system of accountability on finance committed, troops deployed, and economic and other arrangements with the US and other governments.

        \n\n
        
        I am committed to upholding the UN system and peacekeeping force and ensuring that the UK Government acts responsibly, transparently, and accountably and that this is adequately and clearly reported to my constituents.`,

        'EU And Brexit': `Super wealthy hedge funds have cynically used Brexit as an opportunity to avoid European tax regulations and in addition to the democratic deficit in the process occurring at all, the outcomes of Brexit have been disastrous for Scotland. A different relationship for Scotland with the European Union and other European institutions can only be decided after independence, but if there is an open and fair referendum that achieves that, I would support re-entry if that was the decision reached by a participatory democratic process.

        \n\n

        We must not allow Brexit to be used as an opportunity to further vassalize the United Kingdom to the United States of America. Already, American companies own huge swathes of British industry, making over $700 Billion a year in sales to UK consumers.

        \n\n
        
        We should not be forced to accept American food standards or reduced protections to our human rights following Brexit. We should aim to build amity with Europe so we can provide mutual benefits.

        \n\n
        
        I will endeavour to seek closer ties with Europe and give people opportunities to work or do business abroad, with free movement where possible.

        'The Neuclear Issue': `If elected, I will sign the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons Parliamentarians Pledge to work towards the abolition and elimination of all nuclear weapons, because nuclear weapons are the most inhumane and indiscriminate weapons ever created. They violate international law, cause severe environmental damage, undermine national and global security, and divert vast public resources away from meeting human needs. They must be eliminated urgently.

        \n\n

        In 2017, the United Nations came together to write an agreement to ban them completely, through the Treaty on The Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which is now binding on the 70 member states at the UN who have joined the TPNW. Only the handful of nuclear armed states and their complicit allies are resistant to supporting the TPNW.

        \n\n
        
        The UK’s nuclear weapons delivery system and weapons store are all based in Scotland, with no credible alternative site. They have the capacity to wipe out the entirety of a city the size of Moscow, making the central belt a target for attack by nuclear powers who are aware of that.

        \n\n
        
        But so-called nuclear deterrence doesn’t work. Since 1945, conflicts and wars have continued and the fact that nuclear weapons haven’t been used is due solely to good luck, and threats to use nuclear weapons limit any country’s capacity to find better solutions. The nuclear armed states are always poised to launch nuclear weapons which are useless for today’s threats.

        \n\n
        
        The government is replacing its current nuclear weapons system, Trident, at a cost of at least £205 billion. If elected I will demand that this money is used for improving people's lives without threatening the lives of others.

        'Local Government': `As I mentioned previously, I strongly believe in community, and allowing my constituents to have the opportunity to live as part of a community, if they choose. I will be doing everything I can to help address local issues in Edinburgh South which constituents have raised with myself and my team. It is key that members of parliament in Westminster support their constituents on these issues, especially by signing off funding decisions and making sure funds are allocated to the correct areas. Reaching out to the various authorities on behalf of the public can have a significant influence on solving local problems. 

        \n\n

        As an Independent MP, I will have the unique opportunity to hold local government to account. A party affiliated politician would not have the same freedom, due to the external pressures being placed on them by the party structure. The Labour run council for example, which has been responsible for many ongoing issues, has not been properly held to account by the current MP.

        \n\n
        
        The incumbent Labour MP for Edinburgh South has been in office for 14 years and has not been able to resolve many issues, causing further deterioration. It is highly unlikely that he will succeed if he is voted in for another term.

        \n\n
        
        Specifically, I would aim to fund more community projects to allow people to come together. Whether that’s for their mental health, to tackle loneliness or simply to get to know their neighbours.

        \n\n
        
        The following are some local issues that I will address,

        \n\n 

        NHS waiting times

        \n\n

        This constituency is short of doctor’s surgeries, people are suffering from long waiting times or significant failings from PFIs, while others cannot register with a practice at all. A snap inspection of the Royal Infirmary revealed that it was operating at 300% of capacity. Subsequently a new A&E observation ward was built, but more needs to be done. We need to end the exploitation of loose government spending by private contractors and do everything possible attract more GPs, making sure they are paid fairly.

        \n\n

        Another issue, which I will campaign to resolve is far too often new homes are built in areas and homebuilders are allowed to create no infrastructure. Leaving new residents with no availability of spaces at GPs. We all pay for the NHS and should all have access to their services, including GPs and Dentists.
        Cost of Living and Utility bills are too high and spiralling out of control
        Labour and Conservative Governments have created this problem through poor policies. Nothing the government are currently doing appears to be fixing it. Energy costs are skyrocketing due to excessive profit taking by private companies. 
        I would do everything in my power to help my constituents to ease this burden.
        Constant road works & Potholes

        \n\n
        
        Better, more efficient project management is required. We need to make sure contractors do not view government contracts as more lenient or less strict on deadlines than private work. The best solution is to bring in legislation like England, which imposes fines on roadworks contractors who go beyond their promised deadline. 
        
        \n\n 

        There also needs to be forward planning to ensure roads are not dug up one week by a service provider. Then only a month or two later another service provider is back digging the same street up, causing more potholes and cracked pavements.
        
        \n\n

        Bad quality of repairs, broken pavements. Potholes are filled one day and back a month later. Steps will be taken to ensure this is done right first time to avoid budgets having to be adjusted for new year ie April. Labour has been responsible for this and has failed to deliver. 

        \n\n
        
        Policing
        
        \n\n
        The police are understaffed and need more support. We must stop the closure of police stations due to funding cuts and bring back local “bobbies on the beat” who know the people and specific local area. We need visible deterrent community police liaison officers patrolling and more police resources for local issues rather than national edicts from Westminster such as the Policing, Crime and Sentencing Bill 2022. In addition to this, we need a police service that responds quickly to crime, including robberies, theft, and anti-social behaviour. The current system allows petty criminals to run rampage with no deterrent.

        \n\n
        Litter

        \n\n 

        The Council is not doing a good enough job on this. We will look at solutions like fitting clips on bin lids, for when they get blown over. The bin hubs have taken too long to be delivered.

        \n\n
        Anti-social behaviour 

        \n\n
        We must put an end to vandalism to cars, businesses, and other property, which has been on the rise.

        \n\n
        Profit driven housing projects

        \n\n
        Unsuitable student accommodation is being built to garner huge profits and exploit foreign students. Companies overcharge students and get around planning by not providing parking. There is a generalised failure to respect existing residents wishes. If even a small percentage of this space was used for affordable housing, then this could reduce homelessness.
        
        \n\n
        Protecting Astley Ainsley Hospital from objectionable development

        \n\n
        NHS Lothian is planning to dispose of Astley Ainslie in 2025. If this disposal is necessary, we must protect the green space and ensure that the site is used for a pro-social purpose which benefits the public, not just developers.

        \n\n 
        
        Childcare too expensive. Action will be taken against private nursery providers charging excessive prices or failing to invest in facilities and staff. I would also make every effort to influence policy in Westminster to ensure Government initiatives work and do not give with one hand and take from the other.
        I will also work hard in the community to ensure there are more options for parents for which childcare is not an option. There should be better and more accessible playgroups and services for which parents only pay a minimal fee. 
        Businesses suffering from labour shortages
        This problem is inexplicably linked to broader issues such as the lack of affordable housing, long term sickness and changes in working patterns. We must ensure that Edinburgh South is a fantastic place to live and work to attract skilled workers.
        Improving public services in Edinburgh South
        Houses have been built but there is a lack of facilities. A pharmacy and GP surgery is needed. Better public services are required to keep pace with house building, especially in Liberton and Gilmerton.
        Better parking needed for elderly and disabled 
        We must ensure that abuse of disabled spaces is addressed quickly and efficiently.
        More support for local independent businesses/shops
        We need to push for a rejuvenation of the high street. Local, diverse, small businesses are the lifeblood of any thriving community. I will endeavour to shift support away from huge companies and towards supporting small local business however possible. Online businesses should be taxed at the same level as retail, or taxes reduced for small retail businesses.
        Business rates are far too high for many businesses, especially charities. I will seek to provide better support for these businesses to ensure they can continue what they do best, which is serving the people of Edinburgh South.
        Gracemount leisure centre closure
        This is the fault of Westminster; our local MP Ian Murray cannot blame it on the Scottish Government as he has tried to do.
        Edinburgh council closing two of its care homes
        I will push to ensure places are replaced following care home closures at Clovenstone and Ford Road. 
        More efficient council and local government
        We must ensure that local matters are dealt with quickly and effectively. We need to make sure we have great people in local councils who make serving the public their priority. 
        Better recreational areas required for children 
        Research clearly shows that children who play outside in nature are happier, more able to focus and suffer from less mental health issues. We must prioritize the need for outdoor spaces, making sure we have child focussed built environment policies which are enacted immediately.
        In recent years other councils and areas have created wonderful, exciting parks for children, this is something we should create in our constituency to give parents a safe and exciting space for their children to play in.
        Better, more well thought out bicycle lanes needed
        Bicycle lanes must be well maintained and properly planned to reduce accidents. The recently created bike lanes throughout the city, including in this constituency are not consistent or fit for purpose. I would campaign to have bike lanes made very clear, both to keep cyclists on the road safe from cars, as well as pedestrians on the pavement safe from cyclists.`,
